# mixture-model-bandits
This repository contains the scripts written by me during the completion of my MSc thesis, on the topic of mixture model bandits.

thesis.pdf is the output thesis.

All bandit environments are generated from the bandit_class.py or bandit_class_beta.py. The later corresponds to the case that the component distributions follow beta distribution.

Other files contain specific algorithms studied in the thesis, namely UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) algorithm and Thompson Sampling, etc.
